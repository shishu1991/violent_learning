## How to setup MCP server?

Setting up an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server involves installing the necessary dependencies and configuring the server to communicate with AI models and tools. You typically need to define your server endpoints, implement the required protocol handlers, and configure authentication if needed. The server acts as a bridge between AI applications and external tools or data sources.

## Why MCP Server?

MCP servers provide a standardized way for AI applications to access external tools, databases, and services securely and efficiently. They enable AI models to perform actions beyond their training data by connecting to real-time information and computational resources. This architecture promotes modularity, security, and scalability in AI application development.

## WHO should use MCP server?

Developers building AI applications that need to interact with external systems, databases, or APIs should use MCP servers. Organizations looking to integrate AI capabilities into their existing infrastructure while maintaining security and control over data access. Software teams who want to create reusable, standardized interfaces between AI models and their business systems.
