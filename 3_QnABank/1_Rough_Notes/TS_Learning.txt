TS is buit on JS 
TS --> Transpillation -->JS
Statically Typed to resolve most of the bugs during compilation instead of running them and verifying it.










Setting up TS env 
		Install npm or yarn to install the TS globally
		>>>>>>>>> yarn init -y  // Initialize the folder with yarn it---- will create a file with package.json with some details of your project.
		>>>>>>>>> yarn add express body-parser dotenv // add some basic dependency to initialize the server app.--- will add dependencies in your package,json and add yarn.lock file and nodemodeules folder.
		create a file myapp.ts // write the following code into the file -- will give you some as typescript is still not yet there
								const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
								const express = require("express");

								const app = express();

								app.use(bodyParser.json());
								app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

								const PORT:string|number= process.env.PORT || 3000;

								app.listen(PORT,()=>{
								 console.log(`server is running on ${PORT}`);
								});
		>>>>>>>> yarn add typescript //  add dependency of TS -- will add it package.json and download the module in nodemodules
		still some error in your file -- we need a package that offers type definitions for the Node.js runtime and its modules. Let's get that module into our development environment.
		>>>>>>>> yarn add -D @types/node //  get that module into our development environment. --- will see that all the errors are gone

Running the file
		>>>>>>>> yarn tsc .\myapp.ts // tanscompile the file // will generate a js file out of it.
		Now you can execute the js file using commnad
		>>>>>> node .\myapp.js // run the file -- will see output of your file

		But using the methode need two step first to transcompile and then run the js file. we can do it using a single command using ts-node
		>>>>> yarn add ts-node // add the dev dependency of ts-code
		>>>>> yarn ts-node .\myapp.ts // run the file ts directly using ts-code
		
		
USing the TSConfig file
		>> yarn tsc --init // to initiralize the TS config file -- will create a tsconfig.json file 
		Remove the comments on this line inside tsconfig.json
		>> "moduleResolution": "node10"
		Modify the line "outDir": "./",
		>> "outDir": "./build",
		Add it to the end of the file
				,
			  "include": [
				"myapp.ts"  
			  ],
			  "exclude": [
				"node_modules"
			  ]
			  
		You will notice node build/myapp.js. The reason for creating a file like that is, we configured our compiler by modifying the tsconfig.json file.
