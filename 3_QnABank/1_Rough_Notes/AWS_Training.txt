Session -1


Cloud computing  analogy with Electricity 
    Technology ---> Virtua;ization
    Services ---> [EC2]
    Infrastructure --> have set up to provide resources to perform work.
    Access to the Cloud ----> we use internet ISP

On Premises 
	You manage all the Servers, Storage, DB and app
	
Cloud 
	Service Provider manages all the things plus generates the bill.
	

AWS (Business Model)
	===> Data Center::::::: are abstracted physical server and we work with them through services (virtual servers)provided by cloud.
	====> Old Technology + New Possibilities 
	
	Importance and popularity 
		On premises CAAS :
			Procure Invest maintain
		
		CC :
			Cost savings :  
				On premises: Investment (space, cabling, power, cooling, networking, racks, servers)
			           AWS : 0 you can start and no long term contract  
			Provisioning:
				On premises: It takes several hours to spin up the resources (weeks as well) and process as well can be hurdle
				AWS: Takes minutes to spin up the servers as per you rneed
			Server Utilization:
				OnPremises: The utilization of the servers are used only in work hours hence utilization is low and not optimized. ROI says you are using 10% utilization
				AWS: 80-90 % utilization as it is offered globally.
			Capacity Planning : 
				On premises: To predict and provide a base capacity which will fulfill demand. This demand keeps on increasing (underprovisionin and overprovisioning) is always fighting . So to meet we invest but demands always increasing 
				AWS: It meets the demand all the time it increases as per the demand.
			Scalbility or elasticity :   up /down (Vertical scalling) in/out (Horizontal Sacalling)
				On premises :Its difficult and needs investment and needs to maintained and utilized as per demand
				AWS :: It gives you control to to scale 
					Vertical Scalling : 
						There is downtime
						There is limit to extent you can scale up
					Horizontal Scalling:
						It has a cost associated to each new instance you scale out
						It is more preffered
			Availability: 
				                      You have machine if all user are accessing same application and the only mc goes down. Then you lost the availability. 
					Multiple instances are always running in the same DC
					Instances available in different zone
					Instances available in different region
					Instances in multi cloud 
					
				
				Onpremises : 
				
				
				AWS: 
					® 100% availabilty is never provide or can be provided. 
					® They provide is 99.99% is refered as 4 Nines  it can be down 53 minutes in an year
					® 5 nines is not practical with (5.23 minutes in an year)
					® 99% is also not acceptable (3.65) days per year 
	   
		                              ==> Best is 3 nines or 4 nines ******
		
		
			           Disaster recovery 
			                - 100% up time
			                - Has lot of redundant instances 
			                
			CapEx and OpEx (paradign shift) or capital Expense  and operation expense
	
		                        All cound has no CapEx only OpEx
		
		
		
		
		Definition of CC Cloud Computing: NIST 
		
			Five (5) Essential characterstics
				- On Demand self -service
					® Ondemand any time 
					® Should be a self service own my own example (ATM)
				- Broad Network access
					® Globally access 
					® Any device with Internet and browser.
				- Resource Pooling
					- Resources optimizing (Car pooling)
					- Share the resources and cost is reduced.
				- Rapid elasticity
					- Scalling 
					
				- Measured Service (is on provider to give it as free or at cost)
					- Control over usage and bill as per the usage by you.
			Three (3) Services model
					 - SaaS
						Apllication exposed as services easiest 
						No customization we can do it SaaS.
						Integration of  application is not possible.
						Most used model

			         - PaaS
						Need technical expertise to work (Program)
						IDE 
						CLI
						SDK
						APIs
						DB
						PL
						Integration is possible as per choice.
					 
					 - IaaS
						Major model used by operations team to with max technical expertise 
						Provisioning
						Storage 
						Compute
						Network
						Back
						Rstore 
						security and upgrades
						
						
					Two Perspective while using any model
						  User | Provider
					SaaS  only use | Take care of everything
					PaaS  develop app using development env| Takes care of underline infra 
					IaaS  Evrything is controller by user | Physical provisioning of resources   as per demand 
						
			
			
			Four Deployment Models
				States: Who is the owner os the cloud and where is it located?
									User/consumer | 				Owner 						|     Located										| Points
														
				Public: 		Anybody	No restriction| Third party cloud provider like AWS,MS		|     Off site location 							| Protect from anti social people
					
				Private (with virtualization):		Accessed by employee of 1 org  |   Owned by organisation 				    | On-site/premise Private cloud (within IT) ::: Off-Premise (outsource to TP Cloud provider) | Secured and protection both can be provider and consumer
				
				community:   Multiple organisation | Owned by the members of various organisation belonging to same domain      | one of the organisation will be selected and will be resposible for the infra | 
				
				hybrid:  combinition  Public with on-site private 
				
				Cloud bursting: Application is deployed on public cloud for a temporary period to handle additional spike.
				
				
			Various Cloud Provider 
				AWS  32%
				Azure 23%
				
			Cloud 
				Consumer
				Provider: 
				Auditor: Associated with provider and check the services are as per the standard and mentioned in SLA 
				Broker: Knows which is the best among the various service provider Option
				Carrier: ensure connectivity between Consumer and Provider.
				
			
			
			
			
			Responsilbility and taxonomy model
			
								You Manage 					| 					managed by vendor
				
			SaaS			Use application					|                      		All


			PaaS			SC and data you own 			| 						Rest by Vendor
			
			
			IaaS			Control OS and apllication      | 					They control the physical resources  (More flexibility with more responsibilty)
			
			
			
			Challenges
				Security
				Privacy
				Costs 
				Compliance
				Cloud Migration
				Governance 
				Vendor lock-in: Locked with one vendor who has properatory (Owning all the products of one vendor)
				
				
				
			
			
			
			Virtualization 
					single physical resources to be used to run mutilple instances of application using (Containers/ Hypervisor)
					Hypervisor: Segments the machine HW (Host) by providing sperate OS. VMM
					Containers
					
					VM : without OS and Application
					VS : WITH [H/w+ OS+ App]
					AWS uses: Instances of AWS.
					
					
					
					





Session -2  ::::: AWS  
	- Major cloud service provider
	
	Adv
		- Variable expense instead to fixed
		- massive economies of scale
		- No capacity planning is required
		- Increase speed & agility
		- No maintainance of DC
		- Go global in minutes
		
		
		- It is an IaaS at its core
		- Fundamental building blocks thats the customer assembles to meet their requirements
						- Its paradigm is not provide the archietecture everything is your responsibilty
		- Managed services 
		- Unmanaged Services
		
		
		
		
		AWS 
			36 Region --- region with in all continents / Geographical location 
			
			114 AZs are actual DC located 
			
			Two regions GovCloud and GovCloud also china regions are inaaccesible for us.
			Use region near to your customer.
			
			
			During trainining we will work Oregon (4) or N Virginia.
			
			
			
		Region:: Mumbai (3)
			AZ::::: AZ1, AZ2, AZ3 || AWS Suggests always deploy your application in atleast 2 AZ to be availability || Each region as AZ > 2
				Availability Zone : Cluster of DCs each DC is 8 Football Field space to has Physical server/ will reside in a different place within same city with in distance of 300KM
					VS ---> PS ---> DC -----> Cluster of DC ===> AZ1
					VS----> PS----> DC------> Cluster of DC ===> 2a, 2b, 2c , 2d ===> us-west-2 --> Oregon
				Each Region has AZs
				AZ are connected by High speed networking
				Designed for fault isolation 
			
			Local Zone : Is not AZ is extention of region to decrease latency 
			Wavelength Zone : for mobile based application.

	AWS Elactic Bean Stalk : [all the provisioning EBs]
	Aws Outpost : Service that allows you to run AWS Services like Ec2 in your on-premises datacenter
	AWS Serverless Apllication repository.

	Unmanaged service 
	EC2 Elastic compute cloud
		- Elastic IP <Fixed or range of IP which do not change>
			AWS has a pool fo elastic IPs it is scarced resource. You request for an elastic IP. It will allocate the IP from the pool and it is linked to your IP.
			Once you have it you can allocate it to your instance.
				If the instance gets failed it will get associate it to other resource. 
				If you terminate it will IP disassociated
						If you are using EIP it wont be charged but if it diassociated then you will be charged. 
						You have a limit of 5 EIP for each account
						
						
						Private IP always have a private IP
						Public IP may or may not have public
						Elastic IP may or may not have EIP
							EIP = Public if you have EIP which will be used to connect to internet.
						Remapping association time is 180 sec or 3min
							
		- Volumes
			- Root volume size depends on OS which is used to spin up the instance
			- Volume is a storage type of EBs
			- Create a volume for data which goes from 1GB to 16TB
			- Attach it to your instance 
				------ Work with data process 
			-- Remove instance 
				--- instance is removed 
			- Data is still there in volume 
				you can associate with other instance
			- Charges of volume 
				Default size is 100GB
				AWS charges you as per the size you have provisioned so in our case its 100GB
				You cab autoscale the volume.
				Once Volume is created only scalling up is allowed no down is possible
				Volume and instance needs to be in same AZs
				Same volume cannot be associated with 2 instances at the same time.
				mutiple volumes can be associated with multiple instances 
				you can encryption of data on volume
				you can share the data accross regions
					Types 
						- General Purpose SSD  cheaper 
						- Provisioned IOPS SSD for reading and writting  most expensive
						- Cold HDD for non frequent data 
						- Throughput optimized HDD (Slow)for sequential data
						- Magnetic (cheapest unreliable)
					Size 
						1GB to 16TB
					AZ
						Should be selected 
						
		
		Storage 
			Block ----> 
				if not needed create backup (snapshot) which is an object storage. 
					- YOu can restore the backup from snapshot to block(can be modified type, size and AZ and apply encryption) and attach it to instance.
					- Copy snapshot to different region
					- good for striuctured data 
			File
				semi structured nosql
			Object
				unstructured 
			
			
		AMI 
			Image creation from AMI base + custom script
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
Networking and Content delivery 
		VPC:: 
				Company-DC =============> AWS cloud gives you a setup to have private cloud or network within public cloud which is accesible to company only.
						- No infrastruture set up cost and management of infra is taken care by AWS
						- More robust as compared to private cloud 
						- Cost saving 
						- HIgh availability
						- Security : only accesible to your company
						- All instance has to be in a VPC **
						- There is a SG for each region similarly we have VPC for each region.
						- 
						
					Concept 
						IP address: IPV4 and IPV6: a mailing address of a computer connect over internet. 
						Only IPV6 is not possible.
						
						
						Networking concept 
							-- class based IP  routing
							-- Classless interdomain routing - Cider routing  IP block / netmask blocks
								-- netmask /32 --- 2^0 
										/ 31---2^1
										/30---2^2
										/28--2^4
										/24--2^8 =256
										/20--2^12  = 4096
										/16--2^16 ====65.536
							-- IP give me IP address and netmask gives how many ips can be used
							
							
							
							---- VPC exists between /28 to /16 
							--- with 5 IPS are reserved for AWS : ...0,...1,...2,255.255
							
							
							----RFC 1918 rule for IP Address block 
									10.0.0.0--- 10.255.255.255
									172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255
									192.168.0.0 - 172.168.255.255
							
							
					VPC
						- cannot launch the instance directly 
						- cannot be created in a particular AZs
						- 	Break your VPC into subnets
								--Subnets belongs within the a single AZs
								-- Public subnets ::Instance within subnets which can reach out to public internet public subnets
								-- Private subnets ::
							-- VPC has firewall which has NACL (Network Access control list) at subnet level
									
									
							ec2 instance ---> SG at instance level  ----> Subnet has NACL ---> Route table
									        Adding rule in SG means allow the traffic | It is statefull ----> At subnet level you can Allow/Deny | create both rule in NACL for outbound inbound | stateless  --- > 
									
									 
					
					Route table 
						- has rule to direct the traffic to route the traffic in and out
						- Internet 
						
						
						
						
						
						
						
						
						
			VPC Its reginal service and limit is 5.
				Region : oregon 
				AZ : a, b, c, d
					- name : myvpc
					- CIDRblock: 10.0.0.0/16
						Automatically 3 components created 
							- Default SG is created 
							- NACL will be cretaed 
							- Route table WILL BE created as main route table
					- We need to create an internet gateway and attach it to vpc
						- one vpc can have one Internet gateway
					- create a public route table will have rule which allow traffic to internet define destination and target in route table.
					- create subnets public : 10.0.0.0/24 in AZ a  associate it to public route table -- Instance with SG application will run | will have public IP
					- create subnets private 10.0.0.0./24 in AZ backup associate it to main route table -- instance with SG DB will run  | 
					
					
					
					--- NAT Gateway 
							private subnet - >> main route table | rule will be added to allow traffic from private subnet to NAT Gateway which will allowed 
							will use EIP to connect the private subnet
					---- Bastion Host to SSH to private subnet through public subnet 
						
							
					--- Virtual Private gateway 
							-- VPN connectivity --- Customer Gateway ---> finally connect to CDC 
							Direct connect to directly connect VP gateway to CG
							
							
							
							
							
							Default 
								1 VPC 2
								1 NACL 2
								2 SG 3
								1 Route tabel 2 
								
								
								
								
								
		---------------------------------------------------------------
					VPC has 
						tab : Flow log
								- history of the traffic moved in and out of your vpc.
						left panel ->
							Peering connect: connection  between vpcs -->  trasitive peerig is not supported
							Transit gateway : to connect 
							
					AWS VPN	
						Client VPN :  clint to CG
						Site to Site : VPG to CG

		Storage: 
		
			S3 : Simple storage service 
				- Global service Store in 1 region and available in any region. 
				- Ideal for unstructured data  (all files, snapshots)
				- Type 					Block													|  Object
						
									- Stored on HD												| Stored on disk as entity
									- Incremental addition / updateion / deletion				| No incremental addition /updation/deletion
									- Not scalable												| Highly scable
									- 															| 3+trillion object and searhable is constant 
									- limited													| unlimited object					
																								| 5T size is max size of an objects
																								| Stored in buckets
																								| 100 buckets max in a account 
																								| 1 bucket is enough by AWS
																								| Use multiple bucket for convinience 
																								| No Directory structure
																								| bucket name should be small case (alphanumeric and - _ )
																								| unique name thorughout the globe
																								| It follows WORM write once and read many time
																								| Store the snapshot| volume | AMI of your DB but cannot connect to instance
																								| Putting into S3 is free
																								| Reading and 
																								| available 99.99
																								| durable 99.9999999 (11 9s) always 3 copies of objects in every AZs of the region
																								| Encryption is there on all object.
																								| YOu can change the encryption type
																								| transfer acceleration is possible
																								| Storage type 
																										- Std (most expensive)
																										- Intelligent tiering (to transition the object accross different type automatically)
																										- infrequest Access (IA) (1 in months)
																										- one Zone | All copies will be in one zone (durability is 5 9s)
																										- RRS | reduced redundancy storage (Only 2 copies) Availabilty and durabilty will depricate
																								- Glacier | long term storage archiving data  | when data is not frequently retrieved
																										- retreival time is long no real time access
																										- Cheapest storage service
																										- Glacier deep archive
																										- Object are called is archives
																										- Container is valuts instead of bucket 
																										- Size is 40 TB
																										- always encrypted 
																										- Principle WORN ()
																											-- s3 glaciew 
																												expedite  | long
																											-- deep archive 
																								| usage 
																										- Static website
																										- versioning
																										- MFA delete 
																										- Lifecycle management to transition the object through different stoarage
												  														- CRR cross origin replication across  instead of same region it one way replication.
																										- Object Lock (no deletion or termination is allowed)
																										- Event notification on upload delete of an object. 
																										- Set permision to read and write on object using bucket policy.
																										
																									Policy Obeject 
																										- Effect Allow/Deny
																										- Principal: who is allowed * all
																										- Action: action to be allowed 
																										- Resource: which bucket or resource
																										
					
					
					
					CDN 
						- Content delivery network
						- concept is global concept adopted by various org
							- using through CDN there would be a slight delay 
							- set up replication regions via a network
							- replicate regions transfer and cache at edge location 
							- AWS more the 500 CDN location or edge location 
							- Cloudfront is the service that enable CDN 
								- By specifying the distribution in the specif region
								- Enable origin access  control feature which will force the user to CDN only and secure bucket
								- disable WAF
								
								
								
								
					EFS 
						- To create a file and share it within two instances 
						- Lifecycle policy 
							- EFS stnd
							- EFS inferequent storage
							- FSx lustre high io ops 
							- FSx for windows files server (SMB)
					Backup 
						- All types of storage can be backed up.
					Storage agteway
						- for data on premisses and applciation on cloud
						- File Gateway 
						- Volume
						_ tape gateway

		Datawarehouse 
			OLTP---> transaction proceessing 
			OLAP -----> Data over the years for various domains for analytical processing
				----> aggregate function (sum/total/max/min/coutn,average)
				----> we need differenct mechanis to get the results from a Peta bytes of data 
				----> we need different format to store the data 
				----> for business inteligence or analystics 
				DB: 
					- RedShift 
					- it is bloack storage 
					- massive parallel processing 
					- Masters and slaves architeture of hadoop
					- it stores in columns instead of rows columnar storage 
					
		Elastic Cache
				- To store frequently accessed info from DB by application the use elastic cache 
				- To improve performance 
				- Redis more expensive
				- MemcaheD has less feature 
		
		Timestream 
			- time series data 
		Graph 
			- Neptune 
			- tree structure based

				- It means AWS is maintaining and managing thse server
				- Event driven programing 
				- FaaS function as a service
				- Lambda service	
						- you dont wory about BE of the application 
						- User is responsible for code and functions
						- use any language 
				- they provide runtime
				- they setups the infra and you are billed only for the time when code executes.
				- highly scable
				- standalone 
				- trigger based on an event
					
					
					
					
					
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------IaaS (Cloud Formation) 

------------------Set up the infrasture and spin up the application using a code or deployment file.
				--- launch an instance 
						-- AMI
						--Instance type
						-- key pair
						-- SG 
						-- network
						-- user data    
						-- ASG
						-- 
				-- Introduce automation to avoid tedius job 
				-- You can write a code and create template 
				-- Cloud formation 
						- It is used to create template 
						- supports 2 formats json / yaml
								- Teamplate need to define adn specify the requirement (ec2, ami, type, sg, network, userdata)
								- execute template 
								- it creates a stack 
								- use it launches multiple instance and multiple times.
								- it is portable 
								-- designer board / composer you can drag it will place an ec2 
								
								
			----------------------- SNS delivery
			
				- notification service 
				- works on pub /sub model 
				- topic
				- publisher publishes on the topic
				- multiple subcriber can subcribe to multiple topic 
				- 2 type 
					- standard order is nto maintaned 
					- FIFO maintain order 
				- setup topic we need set protocal 
				- email | message | trigger | sqs | http endpoint
				- subcriber has to confirm to the ready to accept the message 
				
						-- steps 
						--- create topic 
						--- give name 
						--- give type (stnd | fifo)
						--- set access policy | publisher - everyone and subcriber- everyone
						-- create topic and then create subcription
						--- Will have ARN which will be to create subscription 
						--- select protocal (email | message | trigger | sqs | http endpoint)
						-- create subscription 
						
						
						-- S3 
						-- got to your bucket > properties 
						--- got to event notification 
						--- create an event notification 
						--- PUT 
						-- Destination 
						-- SNS topic 
						-- choose your topic 
						-- save changes 
						-- uplocad the file 
						
						
		-----------------------SQS processing 
					--- to avoid tight coupling 
					--- never to use loose coupled 
					----type stnd & FIFO 
					-- 4days is the default persists in the queue max to 14days
					--	subcriber pull or polls the queue 
					-- once pulled it is not there if it processed it is deleted 
					-- otherwise it put back

		--- Monolith 
			-- saclability 
			-- tightly coupled

			-- Decoupled the services into modules 
			-- All applications are not suitable for it.
			-- reuired a gateway will be the entery point and will discovery the BE service 
		
		---- API Gateway 
		
		---- Container 
				-- standard unit of software [packaged as application into one unit which is easily portable accross platform]
				-- Docker image [packed software which can be run into]
				--- Virtualization 
					-- hypervisor virtualization (mc is same but OS is seprate)
					-- OS virtualization (OS is shared but containers are seprate)
					-- Hybrid virtualization is also possible 
				--- ECR -- 
					-- Image
					-- Elastic container repository:: docker repository 
					-- ASG and autoscalling for container is possible
					-- Orchestration system :: Docker swarm 
					
					--- A EC2 container service  (ECS) 
							-- Build image
							-- build applcaition and the image
							-- serverless and serverbased (you need configure the ec2)
							-- for ETL extract transforem load type of usecase 
							
								-- Steps 
									-- container defination  image and ocntainer
									-- task defination blue print of applciation by combining application | create container
									-- service for managing the state of the container and maintains the state of container and applciation are up and running
									-- Cluster | grouping of instances with above steps on each container
					-- AWS fargate
						-- Servless container services 
						-- can work with both EKS and ECS
					
					
					Components:
						ECS Cluster: A logical group of resources (EC2 instances or serverless Fargate tasks). It’s equivalent to a Kubernetes Cluster.
						Task Definition: A blueprint specifying containers to run (image, CPU/memory, networking).
						Task: A running instance of a Task Definition (similar to a Kubernetes pod).
						Service: Ensures a specified number of tasks are always running (similar to Kubernetes Deployments).
